"""Graph builders for yamlgraph pipelines.

Provides functions to build pipeline graphs from YAML configuration.

Pipeline Architecture
=====================

The main pipeline follows this flow:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[generate] -->|content| B{should_continue}
    B -->|continue| C[analyze]
    B -->|end| E[END]
    C -->|analysis| D[summarize]
    D --> E[END]
```

State Flow:
- generate: Creates structured content from topic
- analyze: Produces analysis from generated content
- summarize: Combines all outputs into final_summary

Graph Definition:
- Pipelines are defined in graphs/*.yaml
- Loaded and compiled via graph_loader module

        Use `load_and_compile()` with checkpointer instead.
        See reference/checkpointers.md for modern resume pattern.

    This is an alias for build_graph(). Resume works automatically
    because nodes skip execution if their output already exists in state
    (skip_if_exists behavior).

    To resume:
    1. Load saved state from database
    2. Invoke graph with that state
    3. Nodes with existing outputs are skipped

        StateGraph for resume (same as main pipeline)
