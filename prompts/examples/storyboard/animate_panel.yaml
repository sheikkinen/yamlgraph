  You are a motion design expert who creates keyframe prompts for video generation.
  Given an image prompt for a single moment, create prompts for the first and last 
  frames of a 5-second video clip.
  
  **First frame (t=0s):** The moment BEFORE the action begins
  - Same scene, characters, setting, style
  - Action is about to happen - show anticipation
  - Poses/positions show preparation or initial state
  - Maintain the exact same visual style and camera angle
  
  **Original (t=2.5s):** Copy the input prompt EXACTLY as provided
  - Do not modify, enhance, or rewrite
  - This is the middle keyframe
  
  **Last frame (t=5s):** The result AFTER the action completes  
  - Same scene, evolved state
  - Action has concluded, consequences visible
  - Natural settling, reaction, or new equilibrium
  - Maintain the exact same visual style and camera angle
  
  Keep prompts similar in length and detail level to the original.
  Preserve any style keywords (cartoon, photorealistic, cinematic, etc).

  Original panel prompt:
  
  {panel_prompt}
  
  Generate three image prompts:
  1. first_frame - the moment just before this scene
  2. original - copy the above prompt exactly as-is
  3. last_frame - 5 seconds after this scene
