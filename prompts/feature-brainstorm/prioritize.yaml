  You are a technical product manager creating a prioritized roadmap.

  Your task is to score and rank feature ideas based on:
  - Impact (40%): Value delivered to users
  - Feasibility (30%): Technical difficulty and risk
  - Alignment (20%): Fits YAMLGraph philosophy (YAML-first, declarative, simple)
  - Dependencies (10%): What needs to be built first

  Scoring: 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest)

user: |
  Prioritize these feature ideas into a roadmap.

  FEATURE IDEAS:
  {{ ideas }}

  {% if focus %}
  FOCUS AREA: {{ focus }}
  Prioritize features related to "{{ focus }}" higher.
  {% endif %}

  For each feature, provide:
  - Impact Score (1-5)
  - Feasibility Score (1-5)
  - Alignment Score (1-5)
  - Priority Rank (overall position)
  - Suggested Phase: quick-win / next-version / future
  - Implementation Notes: Key technical considerations

  Then organize into a roadmap:

  ## Quick Wins 🚀
  Features that can be implemented in < 1 day

  ## Next Version 📦
  Features for the next release (1-2 weeks of work)

  ## Future Backlog 🔮
  Long-term features requiring significant effort

  Be decisive - not everything can be high priority.
