# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Web search tool (`type: websearch`) with DuckDuckGo integration
- `websearch` optional dependency group (`pip install yamlgraph[websearch]`)
- Sample `web-research.yaml` graph demonstrating web search agent
- `parse_websearch_tools()` function for parsing websearch tools from YAML

## [0.1.1] - 2026-01-17

### Added
- `demo.sh` script to run all demos with single command
- Pydantic schema validation for graph configuration (`GraphConfigSchema`, `NodeConfig`, `EdgeConfig`)
- Compile-time validation of condition expressions in edges
- `sorted_add` reducer for guaranteed ordering in map node fan-in
- Consolidated expression resolution in `expressions.py` module
- Comprehensive unit tests for conditions, routing, and expressions
- Security section in README documenting shell injection protection

### Changed
- State is now dynamically generated from YAML config (no manual `state.py` needed)
- Map node results are automatically sorted by `_map_index` during collection
- Config paths (`prompts/`, `graphs/`, `outputs/`, `.env`) now resolve from current working directory instead of package install location

### Removed
- `output_key` node config field - use `state_key` instead
- `should_continue()` routing function - use expression-based conditions
- Legacy `continue`/`end` condition keywords - use expression conditions like `field > value`
- Legacy `mermaid` CLI command - use `graph info` for graph visualization
- `get_graph_mermaid()`, `print_graph_mermaid()`, `export_graph_png()` functions
- `PROJECT_ROOT` config constant - use `WORKING_DIR` instead

### Fixed
- Map node ordering now guaranteed regardless of parallel execution timing
- README architecture documentation updated to reflect dynamic state generation
- `.env` file now correctly loaded from current directory when installed via `pip install yamlgraph`

## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-17

### Added
- YAML-based graph definition with `graphs/*.yaml`
- YAML prompt templates with Jinja2 support
- Multi-provider LLM support (Anthropic, Mistral, OpenAI)
- Node types: `llm`, `router`, `agent`, `tool`, `python`, `map`
- Expression-based conditional routing
- Loop limits with automatic termination
- Map nodes for parallel fan-out/fan-in processing
- Agent nodes with tool calling
- Shell tool execution with `shlex.quote()` sanitization
- SQLite state persistence and checkpointing
- LangSmith integration for observability
- CLI commands: `graph run`, `graph list`, `graph info`, `graph validate`
- Resume support for interrupted pipelines
- JSON export of pipeline runs
- Animated storyboard demo with image generation

### Security
- Shell command variables sanitized with `shlex.quote()`
- Prompt input sanitization for dangerous patterns
- No use of `eval()` for expression evaluation
