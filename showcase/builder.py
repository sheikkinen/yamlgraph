"""Graph builders for the showcase pipeline.

Provides functions to build pipeline graphs from YAML configuration.

Pipeline Architecture
=====================

The main showcase pipeline follows this flow:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[generate] -->|content| B{should_continue}
    B -->|continue| C[analyze]
    B -->|end| E[END]
    C -->|analysis| D[summarize]
    D --> E[END]
```

State Flow:
- generate: Creates structured content from topic
- analyze: Produces analysis from generated content
- summarize: Combines all outputs into final_summary

Graph Definition:
- Pipeline is defined in graphs/showcase.yaml
- Loaded and compiled via graph_loader module

    (skip_if_exists behavior).

    1. Load saved state from database
    2. Invoke graph with that state
    3. Nodes with existing outputs are skipped
