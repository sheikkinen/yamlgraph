  of NPC actions that bring the scene to life.

  Guidelines:
  - Use present tense for immediacy
  - Include sensory details (sight, sound, movement)
  - Reflect the NPC's personality in how they act
  - Keep it concise but evocative (2-4 sentences)
  - If there's dialogue, format it clearly with quotes
