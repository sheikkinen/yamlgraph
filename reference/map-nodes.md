# Map Nodes Reference

Map nodes enable parallel processing of list items using LangGraph's native `Send` API. Each item in a list is processed independently, and results are automatically collected into a list.

---

## Overview

Map nodes solve the fan-out/fan-in pattern:

```
[item1, item2, item3]  →  process each  →  [result1, result2, result3]
```

**Key features:**
- Parallel execution via LangGraph `Send()`
- Automatic result collection with state reducers
- Supports nested LLM, router, or python sub-nodes
- Full access to parent state in sub-nodes

---

## Basic Syntax

```yaml
nodes:
  process_items:
    type: map
    over: "{state.items}"           # List to iterate
    as: item                        # Variable name for each item
    node:                           # Sub-node to execute per item
      type: llm
      prompt: process_item
      state_key: processed_item
    collect: processed_items        # State key for collected results
```

---

## Properties

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `type` | `string` | Yes | Must be `"map"` |
| `over` | `string` | Yes | State expression for the list to iterate |
| `as` | `string` | Yes | Variable name injected into sub-node |
| `node` | `object` | Yes | Sub-node definition (llm, router, or python) |
| `collect` | `string` | Yes | State key where results are collected |
| `flatten_output` | `bool` | No | Merge `_map_xxx_sub` contents into items (FR-052) |

### `over` Expression

Uses [value expression syntax](expressions.md) — supports nested object access:

```yaml
over: "{state.story.panels}"        # Access nested field
over: "{state.items}"               # Simple list
over: "{state.analysis.key_points}" # Any list in state
```

### `as` Variable

The `as` variable is automatically injected into the sub-node's variables:

```yaml
as: panel                           # Each panel becomes {state.panel}
```

Inside the sub-node, access via `{state.panel}` or `{state.panel.field}`.

### Sub-Node Types

Map nodes support these sub-node types:

| Type | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| `llm` | Transform each item with LLM |
| `router` | Classify/route each item |
| `python` | Custom processing per item (FR-021) |

### Python Sub-Nodes (FR-021)

Python sub-nodes enable parallel Python tool execution within map nodes:

```yaml
tools:
  analyze_text:
    type: python
    module: myproject.tools
    function: analyze_text

nodes:
  analyze:
    type: map
    over: "{state.texts}"
    as: text
    collect: analyses
    node:
      type: python
      tool: analyze_text      # References tools section
      state_key: stats
```

**Key points:**
- Tool must be defined in the `tools:` section with `type: python`
- The `as` variable is injected into the state passed to the Python function
- Results are wrapped and collected with `_map_index` for ordering
- Errors are captured per-item without failing the entire map

**Python function signature:**

```python
def analyze_text(state: dict) -> dict:
    text = state["text"]  # The 'as' variable
    return {"stats": {"word_count": len(text.split())}}
```

See [examples/demos/python-map/](../examples/demos/python-map/) for a complete demo.

## How It Works

1. **Fan-out**: Graph loader creates a conditional edge that uses `Send()` to dispatch each item
2. **Processing**: Sub-node runs independently for each item with the item injected into state
3. **Collection**: Results are collected using a state reducer (`Annotated[list, operator.add]`)

### State Reducer

The `collect` key automatically gets a list reducer:

```python
# Auto-generated state
class State(TypedDict):
    processed_items: Annotated[list, operator.add]  # Reducer for collection
```

### Output Flattening (FR-052)

By default, map results contain internal wrapper keys like `_map_analyze_sub`:

```python
# Default output format
[
    {"_map_index": 0, "_map_analyze_sub": {"score": 0.8, "tag": "relevant"}},
    {"_map_index": 1, "_map_analyze_sub": {"score": 0.3, "tag": "irrelevant"}},
]
```

With `flatten_output: true`, the wrapper contents are merged into each item:

```yaml
nodes:
  analyze:
    type: map
    over: "{state.items}"
    as: item
    node:
      type: llm
      prompt: analyze
      state_key: analysis
    collect: results
    flatten_output: true  # Merge _map_analyze_sub into item
```

Result:
```python
# Flattened output
[
    {"_map_index": 0, "score": 0.8, "tag": "relevant"},
    {"_map_index": 1, "score": 0.3, "tag": "irrelevant"},
]
```

**Behavior notes:**
- Output fields overwrite input fields on conflict
- `_map_index` is preserved for ordering
- Pydantic models are converted via `model_dump()`
- Scalar sub-values are not flattened (kept in wrapper)

## Examples

### Example 1: Animate Story Panels

Transform each panel description into animation frames:

```yaml
# graphs/animated-storyboard.yaml
nodes:
  expand_story:
    type: llm
    prompt: expand_story
    state_key: story              # Returns {panels: [...]}

  animate_panels:
    type: map
    over: "{state.story.panels}"  # List of panel descriptions
    as: panel_prompt
    node:
      type: llm
      prompt: animate_panel
      state_key: animated_panel   # Each iteration produces this
    collect: animated_panels      # All results collected here

edges:
  - from: START
    to: expand_story
  - from: expand_story
    to: animate_panels
  - from: animate_panels
    to: END
```

**Prompt** (`prompts/animate_panel.yaml`):

```yaml
schema:
  name: AnimatedPanel
  fields:
    first_frame:
      type: str
      description: "Opening frame of the animation"
    original:
      type: str
      description: "Middle frame (original panel)"
    last_frame:
      type: str
      description: "Closing frame of the animation"

system: |
  You are an animator. Given a static panel description,
  create three frames showing motion progression.

user: |
  Create animation frames for this panel:
  {panel_prompt}
```

### Example 2: Process with Python Node

Use a custom Python function for each item:

```yaml
nodes:
  generate_images:
    type: map
    over: "{state.animated_panels}"
    as: panel
    node:
      type: python
      tool: generate_panel_image    # References tools section
      state_key: image_result
    collect: images

tools:
  generate_panel_image:
    type: python
    module: myproject.nodes.image_gen
    function: generate_image
```

### Example 3: Classify Each Item

Route each item through classification:

```yaml
nodes:
  classify_items:
    type: map
    over: "{state.items}"
    as: item
    node:
      type: router
      prompt: classify_item
      routes:
        urgent: handle_urgent
        normal: handle_normal
      default_route: handle_normal
    collect: classifications
```

  --var concept="A brave mouse knight on an adventure" \
  --var model=hidream
```

## Implementation Details

### Generated Node Structure

For a map node named `animate_panels`, the loader creates:

1. **Dispatch node** (`animate_panels`): Reads the list and sends items
2. **Sub-node** (`_map_animate_panels_sub`): Processes each item
3. **Conditional edge**: Routes from dispatch to sub-node via `Send()`

### State During Execution

Each sub-node execution receives:

```python
{
    # Full parent state
    "story": {...},
    "concept": "...",

    # Injected item (from `as: panel_prompt`)
    "panel_prompt": "The knight approaches the castle...",

    # Map tracking
    "_map_index": 0,  # Index in the list
}
```

### Result Collection

Results include `_map_index` for ordering:

```python
animated_panels = [
    {"_map_index": 0, "first_frame": "...", "original": "...", "last_frame": "..."},
    {"_map_index": 1, "first_frame": "...", "original": "...", "last_frame": "..."},
    {"_map_index": 2, "first_frame": "...", "original": "...", "last_frame": "..."},
]
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep sub-nodes simple**: One LLM call or one Python function per item
2. **Use descriptive `as` names**: `panel`, `document`, `item` - not `x` or `i`
3. **Handle empty lists**: Map nodes gracefully skip if the list is empty
4. **Order matters**: Results maintain order via `_map_index`
5. **State isolation**: Each sub-node gets a copy of state; mutations don't affect siblings

## Comparison with Other Patterns

| Pattern | Use Case | Parallelism |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Map** | Same operation on each item | Native parallel via `Send()` |
| **Loop** | Iterative refinement | Sequential |
| **Router** | Different paths based on classification | Single path |
| **Agent** | Autonomous tool selection | Sequential tool calls |

---

## Async Execution for Parallel Performance

Map nodes use LangGraph's `Send()` for parallel fan-out. However, **parallel execution behavior varies by provider and execution mode**:

| Provider | `invoke()` | `ainvoke()` | Recommendation |
|----------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| Anthropic | ✅ Parallel | ✅ Parallel | Works with both |
| OpenAI | ✅ Parallel | ✅ Parallel | Works with both |
| Mistral | ❌ Sequential | ✅ Parallel | **Use --async flag** |

### Using the --async Flag

For guaranteed parallel execution with any provider, use the `--async` flag:

```bash
# Parallel execution (recommended for map-heavy graphs)
yamlgraph graph run examples/demos/map/graph.yaml --var topic="AI" --async

# Default sync execution (may be sequential with Mistral)
yamlgraph graph run examples/demos/map/graph.yaml --var topic="AI"
```

### Programmatic Async Execution

In Python, use `ainvoke()` instead of `invoke()`:

```python
import asyncio
from yamlgraph.graph_loader import load_and_compile

async def run_parallel():
    graph = load_and_compile("examples/demos/map/graph.yaml")
    app = graph.compile()

    # Use ainvoke for parallel map execution
    result = await app.ainvoke({"topic": "AI"})
    return result

result = asyncio.run(run_parallel())
```

### Performance Example

For 5 map items with ~3s LLM calls each:
- **Sequential (Mistral + invoke)**: ~15s
- **Parallel (any provider + ainvoke)**: ~3-4s

---

## Local LLM Limitations

Map nodes use LangGraph's `Send()` API which parallelizes **all items simultaneously**. This causes issues with:

### Local LLM Servers (LM Studio, Ollama)

Local LLM servers typically handle **one request at a time**. A map node with 25 items sends 25 parallel requests, causing hangs or timeouts.

**Workaround**: Use a cloud provider for map-heavy graphs:

```bash
# Instead of local LLM
PROVIDER=anthropic yamlgraph graph run pipeline.yaml
```

### Rate-Limited APIs

Burst of many parallel requests may hit rate limits. Use the `retry` configuration (FR-031):

```yaml
# When FR-031 is implemented:
nodes:
  expand_cell:
    type: llm
    retry:
      max_attempts: 5
      backoff_factor: 2.0
      jitter: true  # Prevents retry storms
```

### Design Decision

Concurrency control was considered (FR-030) but rejected:
- LangGraph's `Send()` doesn't support native concurrency limits
- Adding it would require 200+ lines of async complexity
- Workaround is simpler: use cloud provider or sequential graph pattern

**Alternative**: For sequential processing, use a loop pattern instead of map:

```yaml
nodes:
  process_one:
    type: llm
    prompt: process_item
    state_key: current_result

edges:
  - from: process_one
    to: accumulate
  - from: accumulate
    to: process_one
    condition: "len(state.processed) < len(state.items)"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "List is empty"

```yaml
over: "{state.items}"  # Check that upstream node populates this
```

Ensure the `over` expression points to a populated list.

### "Cannot access field"

```yaml
as: panel
# In sub-node:
variables:
  prompt: "{state.panel}"        # ✅ Correct
  prompt: "{state.panel_prompt}" # ❌ Wrong if as: panel
```

The `as` name must match exactly in variables.

### Results not collected

The `collect` key is automatically added to state with a `sorted_add` reducer that:
- Collects results from all parallel branches
- Sorts by `_map_index` to maintain order

If results aren't appearing, check that:
1. The sub-node's `state_key` matches what you expect
2. The `collect` key name is spelled correctly
3. The sub-node is completing without errors
